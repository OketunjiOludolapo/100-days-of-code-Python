# Day 11 of 100 days of code 

## **Brief Summary about the course**
 This is the eleventh day of the challenge and i  started by taking Instructor Yu Angela's 100 days of code(Python Bootcamp) course on Udemy to complete this challenge. Click [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) for the course link. The course promises to teach from basics to advanced Python and can be a good refresher for professionals.


## **About Day 11 Project**
Today's project is the first capstone project of the course and it was about recreating Blackjack game and rules using Python. To build the Blackjack game, I utilized all the learnings from day 1-10 and those made it the project less difficult.
