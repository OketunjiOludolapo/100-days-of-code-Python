**This is the start of my 100 days of code journey. I will be focusing on Python Programming language. The aim of participating in this challenge is to refresh my python knowledge and also create some awesome projects
I have started by taking Instructor Yu Angela's 100 days of code(Python Bootcamp) course on Udemy. Click [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) for the course link. The course promises to teach from basics to advanced Python and can be a good refresher for professionals.**

**I will be uploading daily projects for the 100 days and will be committing them in this repository.**

## Note: You can view and use some of the projects on a deployed web app via this [link]("http://streamlit100days.herokuapp.com/")
