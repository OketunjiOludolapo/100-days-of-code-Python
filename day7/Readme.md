## **Brief Summary about the course**
 This is the first day of the challenge and i have started by taking Instructor Yu Angela's 100 days of code(Python Bootcamp) course on Udemy. Click [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) for the course link. The course promises to teach from basics to advanced Python and can be a good refresher for professionals.

## **Major lessons in the day 7.**
Practical application of For loops, while loops and logical thinking. This course is continually strengthening my thought process and how i approach problems now. 


## **About this Day 7 Project**
Today's project was creating the hangman game using Python. It was really challenging but showed how and why we use the different type of loops as well as control flow statements. The game is a guessing game. The player has 6 lives at the start of the game. Then he/she has to guess a letter from an unseen word (challengingðŸ˜‚..guessing a letter from a word you don't know) and when he/she guesses wrong, a life is lost and the noose starts coming down. When all lives are lost, the man gets hanged(Hence the word hanging man). If the letters are succesfully guessed before the end of lives, then the player has won. Challenging but fun,rightðŸ˜Ž
