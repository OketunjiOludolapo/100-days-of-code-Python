## **About this Day 8 Project**
Today's project is about replicating Caesar's cipher technique. In the time past, Caesar used his cipher method to encode messages that could only be decrypted by a secret code that the recipent knows. This program replicated that and can be used to encode or decode a message encrypted using Caesar's cipher method.
